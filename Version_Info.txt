v5 Ah yes: Back, been mostly assisting family with basic stuff. Pretty much prepared them last month before the stores
		started to lose a lot of stock in the couple of days. Got them more than prepared just in case hard lock-downs
			does occur, not a fan of waiting till the last minute, and worring if you have enough for the family or not.
			besides that mostly got them quite a number of snacks and other goodies in these couple of days to supplement
			the main stuff that was aquired beforehand. On top of that been working on more physical improvements. The better physic I am
			the better my mental strength will be for aquiring even more knowledge & information! That is the life of a scientist and explorer
			of this wonderful universe of ours. Been having a lot of benefits from it, and glad Im started to work on them. The better I can improve my
			self then I would be able to improve the lives of others and see them fulfil their potential. Life is full of mysteries & unknowns waiting
			to be discovered!! So much to do,learn,experience!! Fills me with so much joy and excitment , seeing the progress of our species, and other
			lifeforms that we share on this planet of ours. Ah! words cant explain it, too much, could go on for hours prhaps days lel. 
		
			Anyways to the main objectives:
			* DB for python, just testing for the full stack/front end site respo, but it will be on a new respo called DB0, which will be the temp testing
			ground for a db. Once I aquire more resources will be aquiring a server to use for my a.i and other experiments/servers. Have a lot of plans
			for the future, and want to further improve my skills, and implementing them onto the world. Want to further improve our understanding of code, the universe,
			and our connection to our future brethern as well. The future is ready to be written, it is up to you to make that step forward to write what your life will be
			. Do the impossible, dare to question to norm, and become more than your potential, while assisting others to achieve their potentials as well! Show the world what it
			means to be a human! Show the world what it means to be alive! Mark your life as a stepping stone to further improve your life,family,local community,your country, and this
			great world of ours that we call Earth!

v6 AWS: Currently working on a couple of aws projects such as machine learning , and a django site that can be accessed online.
ML is a big plus, since I currently lack a physical server, but using aws will further increase my skill set in using cloud 
computing to help aid in the creation of artifical intelligence!	

v6 Edit: Fixed version_info for AWS version update


--v7 AWS: Currently in progress of testing out a couple of features for AWS, planning on using it for future projects, such
            as machine learning, web hosting, and other goodies. Besides that learning a bit of C# to help aid in a couple
            of objectives that I'm working at at the moment. Will update this git in the following weeks. Besides that
            stay safe and always aim to exceed your limits, and do the impossible.
